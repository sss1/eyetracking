1) Resynchronize ET and TI time in video plot, using util.interpolate_to_length
2) Label active state in video plot (e.g., with scatter point)
3) Tune parameters until results look reasonable
4) Figure out how to handle missing eye-tracker data
   - Options:
     1) Assume each state emits NaN with equal probability - what to do for inattentive state?
     2) Remove nan time points, and treat segments separately - easy but wrong
     3) Categorize as new state - what is the transition prob. from this state?
5) Add inattentive state
   - What is the distribution? Uniform over the screen?

...

N) Implement EM (Baum-Welch) to improve transition matrices, covariance, etc.
